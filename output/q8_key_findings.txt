KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY:
====================

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Best performing model: XGBoost(R² = 0.74, RMSE = 5.09, MAE = 3.29)
- Linear Regression (R² = 0.42, RMSE = 7.69, MAE = 5.74)
- XGBoost outperforms Linear Regression

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
 - Top 3 features: Wet Bulb Temperature (importance: 0.64), Battery Life (importance: 0.21), wetbulb_humidity_diff (importance: 0.04)

TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
- Clear seasonal patterns in temperature data
- Warmer in summer and cooler in winter
- Monthly cycles are important predictors

DATA QUALITY:
- Dataset cleaned: 13,426 rows (196,194 to 182,768 rows)
- Missing values handled via ffill, bfill, median, and mode depending on the data type
- Outliers capped using IQR method
